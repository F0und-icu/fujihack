# Fujifilm Custom Firmware
Fujifilm firmware unpacker, repacker, and code injector.  

This will only work on modern Fujifilm cameras, such as the HS20EXR or the X-T4.  
Fujifilm has been using this firmware format since [2005](https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/support/download/procedure-finepix-z/).  

## How to Use
Don't, at least not yet. If you are interested or have questions,  
please send me an email at brikbusters@gmail.com (or create a Github issue)

If you just want to unpack a firmware file:  
```
make asm model=xf1 input=~/Downloads/FPUPDATE.DAT output=FPUPDATE.DAT
```
Type `make help` for some extra info.

Remember that updating to custom firmware files is  
very dangerous. I'm a Canon DSLR user. I'm just hacking  
Fujifilm cameras for fun.  

And remember...   
**If you break it, you get to keep both pieces.**
