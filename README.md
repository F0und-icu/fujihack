Fujifilm firmware unpacker, repacker, and code injector.  

This will only work on modern Fujifilm cameras, such as the HS20EXR or the X-T4.  
It seems like Fujifilm has been using this firmware format since [2005](https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/support/download/procedure-finepix-z/).  

For Fujifilm PTP research, see my my [sequoia-ptp fork](https://github.com/petabyt/fujiptp).

Remember that updating to custom firmware files is  
very dangerous. The only reason I am doing it is so  
that you don't have to. And remember...   
**If you break it, you get to keep both pieces.**
