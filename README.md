# Fujifilm Custom Firmware
Fujifilm firmware unpacker, repacker, and code injector.  

This will only work on modern Fujifilm cameras, such as the HS20EXR or the X-T4.  
Fujifilm has been using this firmware format since [2005](https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/support/download/procedure-finepix-z/).  
This isn't for the Fujifilm S series. [CHDK](https://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=6484.0) already figured out how those.

## How to Use
Don't, at least not yet. If you are interested or have questions,  
contact me (See above)

If you just want to unpack a firmware file:  
```
make unpack model=xf1 input=~/Downloads/FPUPDATE.DAT output=FPUPDATE.DAT
```
Type `make help` for some extra info.

Remember that updating to custom firmware files is  
very dangerous. I'm a Canon DSLR user. I'm just hacking  
Fujifilm cameras for fun.  

And remember...   
**If you break it, you get to keep both pieces.**
